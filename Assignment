ASSIGNMENT

Build a Reddit app which displays only posts with images

App should let user:
    - quickly switch b/w different subreddits (refer to list at the end!)
    - skim through list of posts in a subreddit. Sidebar(hamburger menu)
    - see the full-sized image present in the post
    - choose the subreddits they want
    - use app offline
    - Should be able to use the app offline with the data that was last loaded
Each post should show the image, title, and other metadata (comments count, upvotes etc.)
    - Write Unit Test to test your view and logic

We recommend you to use:
    - retrofit + okhttp, for networking
    - Room, for local persistence
    - Glide, for image loading
    - Gson, for using json in java
    - MVP or MVVM(LiveData) Design pattern
    - Espresso/Mockito for writing Unit test

Feel free to use alternative libraries, if you think they do a better job keeping the size of the app smallest as possible.

We expect a production-level app, that means good UX, performance and maintainable code.
